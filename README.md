# 🎥 Project 4B – Adaptive Bitrate OTT Streaming with AWS

This project demonstrates how to build a real-time **Adaptive Bitrate (ABR) streaming pipeline** using AWS MediaConvert, S3, CloudFront – simulating real OTT platform workflows.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Build an OTT-ready video delivery pipeline that:

- Transcodes `.mp4` video into multiple quality levels using **MediaConvert**
- Delivers video using **CloudFront** with **secure access (OAC)**
- Streams through a custom **HTML5 player** that adapts playback to user bandwidth
- Validates ABR by testing real-time bitrate/resolution switching

---

## 🛠️ Services & Tools Used

| Technology | Role |
|------------|------|
| **Amazon S3** | Stores input `.mp4` and HLS output files securely |
| **AWS MediaConvert** | Generates multi-quality HLS from single input |
| **Amazon CloudFront** | Delivers content via CDN  |
| **OAC (Origin Access Control)** | Restricts S3 access to CloudFront only |
| **DevTools (Network)** | Verified adaptive switching between renditions |

---

## 🔁 Workflow Overview

1. Upload `ABRsample.mp4` to **S3 bucket** (`ott-abr-adaptive`)
2. Run **MediaConvert Automated ABR Job** → outputs HLS to `/output/`
3. Create **CloudFront Distribution** with `Origin path = /output`
4. Configure **OAC + Bucket Policy** to allow secure read access
5. Embed the stream using `master.m3u8` in a **custom Video.js player**
6. Throttle network to simulate ABR behavior and log resolution changes

## 🧪 Bitrate Switching Test

✅ Enabled **DevTools → Network Throttling (Fast 3G)**
✅ Validated real-time switching from 720p → 480p → 360p
